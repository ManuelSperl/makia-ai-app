# Application to create delivery notes for cattles in Dart/Flutter

In Austria, it is neccessary to stop at an intersection marked with a stop sign. 
The Maria.AI project focuses on railroad crossings that are indicated with a stop sign. 
The focus of this work is to simplify the display process of individual cameras for Maria.AI projects. 
This work demonstrates the development of a smartphone application for Android and iOS devices that organizes the 
existing locations and cameras. The functionality of the application includes retrieving data from the existing server 
and displaying them in the application. Additionally, users can be created and managed via Firebase. 
The app is implemented in Dart and uses the Flutter mobile UI framework.

## Main features
- User authentication and user management (Firebase Auth)
- retrieving Data from Server
- displaying the data correctly
- show whether the respective camera is active or not
- Refresh camera image every few seconds
